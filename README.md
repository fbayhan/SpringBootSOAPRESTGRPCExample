## SpringBootSOAPRESTGRPCExample
#Architecture
The application is primarily composed of three main components:


#REST Services: 
Provides the essential APIs for CRUD operations, which are consumed by the frontend application. It serves as the primary interface for managing library data and interactions.


#SOAP Services: 
In addition to REST services, this component handles data flow through SOAP web services, allowing for legacy system compatibility and additional integration points.


#gRPC Services: 
Specifically designed for reporting functions, gRPC services are optimized for performance and efficient data transmission, allowing for real-time and high-volume reporting capabilities.


The interactions between these components create a robust library application capable of handling various operations efficiently while ensuring smooth communication between the backend services and the frontend client.
